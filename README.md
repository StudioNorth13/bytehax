# RockTube Rewritten
Yeah that's right, RockTube but better.
Now with:
- Audio
- Images
- (possibly) Text
- Bootstrap 3, big improvement over Bootstrap 1 (used in RevTube)
- Profile pictures (damn real?)
## RockTube v0.0.11-bs3

### How will you accomplish this?
Audio and images should be fairly easy, I'll just need to make some changes to the database structure, and edit the uploaders to work with those formats. For text, I say it's a possibility because it wouldn't involve uploading files, which would require me to make a new "uploader" that doesn't need a file.
