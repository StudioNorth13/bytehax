Yeah that's right, RevTube but better, now with a brand new UI.
Now with:
- Audio (not being added right now)
- Images
- (possibly) Text
- Profile pictures (damn real?)
- Working follow/subscribe
## byteHax v0.0.1-ui-refresh
No preview yet
<!--![preview](http://dev.rocktube.ml/static/preview/betafeb7-17.png)-->
Progress (in %)? About 2% complete for the UI.
### How will you accomplish this?
~~Audio and images~~ Images should be fairly easy, I'll just need to make some changes to the database structure, and edit the uploader to work with image formats. For text, I say it's a possibility because it wouldn't involve uploading files, which would require me to make a new "uploader" that doesn't need a file. On the other hand, I would need to make tons of media view pages, upload pages, and database tables. Due to this I am removing audio for the time being, leaving videos and images.
### Estimated non-beta release?
Mid-2022, I would say. Or, at earliest, March or April.
